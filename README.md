### Project Overview
---
This Data Analysis project aims to generate insight into the sales performance of the E-commerce project over the past year. By analysing the various parameters in the data received we seek to gather enough insight to make reasonable decisions which then enable us to tell compelling stories around our data from the insight gotten and to know the best performance from our data.

### Data Sources
---
The primary source of Data used here is Data Sale.csv and this is an open source data that can be freely downloaded from an open source online such as Kaggle or FRED or any other data repository site. 

### Tools Used
---
- Microsoft Excel (Download Here)(https://www.microsoft.com)
  1. For Data Cleaning
  2. For Analysis
  3. For Visualization
     
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Quering of Data
- GitHub for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
In the initial phase of the Data cleaning and preparations, we perform the following actions;
  1. Data loading and Inspection
  2. Handling missing variables
  3. Data Cleaning and formatting
